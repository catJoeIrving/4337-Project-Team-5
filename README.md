# Repo for Team 5 project for COSC 4337

Method 1: Python IDE (PyCharm, VSC, etc.):

1) Open your Python IDE.
2) Download the project.py file from this repository.
3) Download the kidney_disease.csv dataset. Make sure this is in the same directory as your Python file or provide the full path to the file in the pd.read_csv() function.
4) Run the program. You can usually do this by right-clicking in the file and selecting ‘Run’, or using a keyboard shortcut (often F5 or Ctrl+Shift+F10 in many IDEs).
5) The IDE will execute the code and you can see the output in the console.

Method 2: Python Notebook:

1) Open your Python Notebook application.
2) You have two options here:
Option 1: Create a new Python notebook file and copy each section of the provided code into a separate cell in the notebook.
Option 2: Download the project.ipynb file from your GitHub repository and open it in your Python Notebook application.
3) If you’re following Option 1, you can create a new cell by clicking on the ‘+’ button in the toolbar.
4) Similar to the Python IDE, ensure the dataset kidney_disease.csv is in the same directory as your notebook or provide the full path to the file in the pd.read_csv() function.
5) To run the code, select each cell and then click the ‘Run’ button in the toolbar, or press Shift+Enter. The output of each cell will appear below the cell.
Note: Jupyter Notebook automatically saves your work. You can also manually save by clicking on the ‘Save’ button in the toolbar or by pressing Ctrl+S.
